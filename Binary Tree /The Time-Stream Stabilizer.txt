                                  #  Project: The Time-Stream Stabilizer
Welcome, Time Agent.
You work for the Chronos Corporation. The fabric of the universe is collapsing because historical events 
are becoming disordered. To save existence, we have digitized the timeline into a Binary Search Tree (BST).
Your mission is to build the Time-Stream Stabilizer software. You must inject events into their correct
chronological positions, remove paradoxes, and report the status of history.

# The Data Structure
The timeline is strictly linear. You must implement a BST where every node is a Time Capsule:

struct TimeCapsule {
    int year;               // The Key
    string eventName;       // The Data
    TimeCapsule* left;      // Earlier years
    TimeCapsule* right;     // Later years
};

The Laws of Time (BST Properties) :
Chronological Order: All years smaller than the current node must be in the Left Subtree.
Future Progression: All years larger than the current node must be in the Right Subtree.
Uniqueness: No two events can happen in the exact same year (Duplicate keys are not allowed).

Required Commands :
Your system must accept the following command inputs:
Command	BST Operation	Description
INJECT <Year> <Name>	Insert	Insert a new historical event. If the year exists, do nothing.
PARADOX <Year>	Delete	A time paradox has occurred! Remove this year from the tree. (Handle cases with 0, 1, or 2 children).
SEARCH <Year>	Search	Check if an event exists in a specific year. Print the event name if found.
REPORT	In-Order Traversal	Print the entire timeline in chronological order (Ascending).
Sample Test Case
Input Data:

INJECT 2050 "Mars Colony Established"
INJECT 1969 "Moon Landing"
INJECT 2100 "Warp Drive Invented"
INJECT 2000 "Y2K Bug"
SEARCH 1969
INJECT 1990 "World Wide Web"
PARADOX 2000
REPORT
SEARCH 2000
Expected Console Output:

> System: Injecting 2050... Timeline stable.
> System: Injecting 1969... Timeline stable.
> System: Injecting 2100... Timeline stable.
> System: Injecting 2000... Timeline stable.

> Query: Searching for 1969...
> Result: Event Found! [1969: Moon Landing]

> System: Injecting 1990... Timeline stable.

> Alert: Paradox detected at 2000!
> System: Year 2000 removed. Timeline stabilized.

> COMMAND: CHRONOLOGICAL REPORT
-------------------------------
1969: Moon Landing
1990: World Wide Web
2050: Mars Colony Established
2100: Warp Drive Invented
-------------------------------

> Query: Searching for 2000...
> Result: Year 2000 not found in current timeline.
🏆 Boss Level Challenge (Bonus)
If you complete the stabilizer early, implement the Time Span Calculator:

Function: int CalculateTimeSpan()
Logic: Find the earliest year (Min) and the latest year (Max) in the tree.
Return: Max - Min.
Constraint: You must do this by traversing the tree, not by sorting an array.
