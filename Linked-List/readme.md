                                                          Linked List Data Structure in C++

📘 Overview :
This project demonstrates a robust and interactive implementation of a Singly Linked List using C++ and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.
It was developed as part of the Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) learning module to explore the power of dynamic memory, pointer manipulation,
and data organization without relying on built-in containers like vectors or arrays.
The program offers a menu-driven system allowing users to perform all fundamental linked list operations while observing real-time memory linkage through clear console output.

⚙️ Core Features:

➕ Add Node (Beginning/End/Position)	Dynamically inserts a node at any point in the list
❌ Delete Node	Removes a specific node by value or position
🔍 Search Node	Locates data within the linked list
📜 Display List	Traverses and prints all elements with proper linkage
🔁 Reverse List	Reverses the node order dynamically
⚡ Count Nodes	Returns the total number of elements in the list
🧹 Clear List	Deletes all nodes to prevent memory leaks


🧠 Conceptual Understanding

The Linked List is a linear data structure where each element (node) contains:
Data — the actual value stored.
Pointer (next) — a reference to the next node.
Unlike arrays, linked lists do not use contiguous memory, allowing efficient insertions and deletions without shifting data.

Head → [ Data | Next ] → [ Data | Next ] → [ Data | Null ]

🚀 Execution Example
===== Linked List Menu =====
1. Add at Beginning
2. Add at End
3. Delete Node
4. Search Node
5. Display List
6. Reverse List
7. Exit
=============================
Enter your choice: 1
Enter data: Shujaa
Node added successfully!


Output:
Head → [ Shujaa | 123 ] → [ Khan | 234 ] → [ Ali | 345 ] → Null



📈 Future Enhancements :

Implement Doubly Linked List and Circular Linked List modules.
Add File Handling for saving and loading data.
Create a Graphical Linked List Visualizer (SFML or Qt-based).
Integrate unit testing using GoogleTest.


🧾 Learning Outcomes:

✅ Strong grasp of pointer-based memory allocation.
✅ Deeper understanding of linked data structures.
✅ Enhanced logic for dynamic problem-solving in C++.
✅ Foundation for advanced structures (Stacks, Queues, Graphs).
