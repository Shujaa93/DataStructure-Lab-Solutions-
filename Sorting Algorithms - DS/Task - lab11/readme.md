#  Student Performance Analytics System
Background Story
You have been hired as a software developer for EduTrack Systems, a company that provides comprehensive academic
performance analysis tools for educational institutions. The company has recently secured a contract with a prestigious
university that wants to analyze student performance data from multiple departments across different semesters.
The university's legacy system stores student records in text files, and your task is to develop a robust data
processing system that can handle these records efficiently using dynamic memory allocation techniques.

# Problem Description

The university maintains student records where each student has the following information:
Student ID (a unique 6-digit number)
Student Name (string, may contain spaces)
Department Code (3-character string: CSE, EEE, MEC, CIV, etc.)
Semester (integer: 1 to 8)
CGPA (floating-point: 0.00 to 4.00)
Credit Hours Completed (integer)
Enrollment Year (4-digit year)
Your Task
Develop a comprehensive C++ program that performs the following operations:

Part 1: Data Ingestion and Storage
Read student records from an input file named students_data.txt
Store all records in a dynamically allocated linked list structure
Each node should contain one complete student record
Handle any number of student records (the count is not known beforehand)
Part 2: Multi-Criteria Analysis and Reporting
Your program must generate four separate output files, each containing differently organized student data:

Output File 1: ranked_by_cgpa.txt
Organize students in descending order of CGPA
For students with identical CGPA, arrange them by Credit Hours Completed (descending)
Include ranking numbers (1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc.)
Display all student information in a formatted table
Output File 2: sorted_by_enrollment.txt
Organize students in ascending order of Enrollment Year
Within the same year, sort by Student ID (ascending)
Create separate sections for each enrollment year
Calculate and display average CGPA for each enrollment year cohort

Output File 3: department_analysis.txt
Group students by Department Code (alphabetically)
Within each department, arrange students by Semester (ascending)
Within the same semester, order by CGPA (descending)
Calculate department-wise statistics:
Total students in department
Average CGPA
Highest and lowest CGPA
Average credit hours completed

Output File 4: performance_tiers.txt
Categorize students into performance tiers:
Elite Tier: CGPA ≥ 3.70
High Achievers: 3.30 ≤ CGPA < 3.70
Good Standing: 3.00 ≤ CGPA < 3.30
Satisfactory: 2.50 ≤ CGPA < 3.00
Needs Improvement: CGPA < 2.50
Within each tier, arrange students alphabetically by name
Display the count and percentage of students in each tier

# Input File Format:
The students_data.txt file will follow this format:

<Total_Number_of_Students>
<Student_ID> <Student_Name> <Department_Code> <Semester> <CGPA> <Credit_Hours> <Enrollment_Year>
<Student_ID> <Student_Name> <Department_Code> <Semester> <CGPA> <Credit_Hours> <Enrollment_Year>
...
Example:

202301 Alice Johnson CSE 5 3.85 142 2020
202145 Bob Smith EEE 6 3.92 168 2019
203012 Charlie Brown MEC 3 3.45 89 2022
201987 Diana Prince CSE 7 3.78 195 2018
202589 Edward Stark CIV 4 3.21 112 2021
Technical Requirements
Mandatory Implementation Constraints:
Dynamic Memory Management

Use a singly linked list with dynamic node allocation
Implement proper memory deallocation (no memory leaks)
Do NOT use arrays or vectors for primary storage
Sorting Methodology

You must implement at least two different comparison-based sorting algorithms
Each sorting algorithm should be applied to different output file requirements
Consider algorithms that work efficiently with linked list structures
Your implementation should handle sorting by comparing adjacent or selected elements
Optimize for scenarios where data might be partially sorted
File Handling

Use separate functions for different sorting operations
Implement modular design with clear function purposes
Use structures/classes for student records
Include appropriate comments and documentation

Deliverables
Complete C++ source code files (.cpp and .h files if using header files)
Sample input file (students_data.txt) with at least 25 student records
All four output files generated by your program
Evaluation Criteria
Correctness (40%): Program produces accurate results for all outputs
Implementation Quality (25%): Proper use of linked lists, efficient algorithms
Code Quality (15%): Clean code, modular design, proper documentation
File Handling (10%): Robust input/output operations
Edge Case Handling (10%): Program handles various scenarios gracefully
Sample Output Format (for ranked_by_cgpa.txt):
